# ClassExamples/RootFinding
Implementations of Bisection and Newton-Raphson.
Each uses rfArgs.py to set bracketing interval (a,b) and tolerance value.
Both include some bracketing checks and check on convergence 
to requested tolerance.

## BisectionExample.py
Basic implementation of bisection (divide and conquer) approach.

## NewtonRaphson.py
Implementation of Newton-Raphson. (needs first derivative).
