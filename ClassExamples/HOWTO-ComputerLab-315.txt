315 Computer Lab Setup Notes

1. The computers in the department's computer lab use Linux.
   They are currently configured with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. 
   You can use the computer lab as long as it is not being used by another 
   class during that class time.

2. You can login to each computer with your KU username and password, 
   but each computer has its own local environment. 
   So the class policy is that you should pick a seat and stick to it 
   to avoid the need to reconfigure more than one machine.
   
3. To open a terminal window you can do CTRL-ALT-T. (a keyboard shortcut)

4. The following steps are to set up an up-to-date python 
   environment with ROOT, matplotlib, numpy, scipy using "conda" from the 
   terminal window. These "315 instructions" assume that you already have 
   ROOT and conda activated (the case for Andrew and Julia).
   See separate instructions if you have not installed ROOT or conda 
   in your configuration (Gabriel and Seth's case).

  0) $  cd $HOME; pwd          # Makes sure you are in your home directory (/home/yourusername)
  
  a) $  echo $ROOTSYS          # Checks if you currently have a version of ROOT enabled.
        Assuming this is not blank you need to edit your .bashrc file and 
        comment out lines like
        ". /opt/root/bin/thisroot.sh" at the bottom. Just add a # at the start of the active line. 
   
  b) $ gedit .bashrc &        # Open and edit the file with the gedit editor ... be careful not to make mistakes.
  
  c) $  . .bashrc             # Runs initialization script again (same as logging out and back in)
  
  d) You should be in the (base) conda environment. If not do $ conda activate
  
  e) $  conda create -n rootenv # creates new conda environment named rootenv
     $  conda activate rootenv  # activate the rootenv conda environment
     $  conda install -c conda-forge root matplotlib scipy   # Takes about 10 minutes - maybe longer.
     
  e) Update your .bashrc to activate the conda rootenv automatically
     $  gedit .bashrc &       # Open the file with the gedit editor ... be careful not to make mistakes.
     At the bottom of the file after the line with 
     # <<< conda initialize <<<               
     
     Add the line:
     source activate rootenv
     
     and save the .bashrc file, and exit from the editor.
     
  f) $  . .bashrc             # Runs initialization script again (same as logging out and back in)   
     
   At this point your prompt should say (rootenv), and you should be able to run all the 
   examples in the ClassExamples git repository. If not let me know. 
   With these changes you should always be in the same configuration, and will not need to 
   do these steps again, on subsequent logins.
