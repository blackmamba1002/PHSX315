315/615/815/914 Computer Lab Setup Notes

1. The computers in the department's computer lab use Linux.
   They are currently configured with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. 
   You can use the computer lab as long as it is not being used by another 
   class during that class time.

2. You can login to each computer with your KU username and password, 
   but each computer has its own local environment. 
   So the class policy is that you should pick a seat and stick to it 
   to avoid the need to reconfigure more than one machine.
   
3. To open a terminal window you can do CTRL-ALT-T. (a keyboard shortcut)

4. The following steps are to set up an up-to-date python 
   environment with ROOT, matplotlib, numpy, scipy using "conda" from the 
   terminal window. This assumes that you have never used these machines before 
   and do not have ROOT or conda activated.
   See separate "315 instructions" if you already have ROOT and conda activated.

  0) $  cd $HOME; pwd          # Makes sure you are in your home directory (/home/yourusername)
  
  a) $  echo $ROOTSYS          # Checks if you currently have a version of ROOT enabled.
        If blank - then you can proceed. Otherwise let me know.
        (some of you have something like ". /opt/root/bin/thisroot.sh" 
         that needs to be commented out of your .bashrc file and reinitialization redone)

  b) $  /opt/conda/bin/conda init bash # Initialize account to use conda (only need to do once)
  
  c) $  . .bashrc             # Runs initialization script again (same as logging out and back in)
  
  d) $  conda create -n rootenv # creates conda environment 
     $  conda activate rootenv  # activate the rootenv conda environment
     $  conda install -c conda-forge root matplotlib scipy   # Takes about 10 minutes - maybe longer.
     
  e) Update your .bashrc to activate the conda rootenv automatically
     $  gedit .bashrc &       # Open the file with the gedit editor ... be careful not to make mistakes.
     At the bottom of the file after the line with 
     # <<< conda initialize <<<               
     
     Add the line:
     source activate rootenv
     
     and save the .bashrc file, and exit from the editor.
     
  f) $  . .bashrc             # Runs initialization script again (same as logging out and back in)   
     
   At this point your prompt should say (rootenv), and you should be able to run all the 
   examples in the ClassExamples git repository. If not let me know. With these changes you 
   should always be in the same configuration, and will not need to do these 
   steps again, on subsequent logins.
