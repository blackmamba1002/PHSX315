Code written for PHSX 315 (Computational Physics) at the University of Kansas, from Fall 2023. It is an introductory course on doing "basic" computational work for physics problems. Topics encompassed monte carlo simulation, chi-squared statistics and hypothesis testing, modelling and fitting multivariate data, and data analysis. Such tasks are very common within actual research (in condensed matter, at least), and while my newer code is much more refined and readable, the different projects here demonstrate the fundamentals well.
